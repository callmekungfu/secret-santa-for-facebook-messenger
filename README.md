# Secret Santa For Friends (In development)
A chatbot extension for Facebook Messenger Platform.

## The Backstory
As holiday season approaches, me and my friends are getting together to celebrate Christmas, one of our traditions is Secret Santa gift exchanges. However, as people are getting busier and busier due to school and work; it is more and more challenging to gather everyone together to draw from a hat. This is not even half of the pain drawing from a hat presents to us.

So this year, we decided to look into alternative methods - online secret santa list generators, but looking through them I found a common problem: they all require email of the participants. We are sassy teenagers, who the heck still uses emails? Then I realized, wait a minute, we are all in a group chat, why not build a bot for our groupchat to streamline the way we celebrate this annual occasion! ðŸŽ…ðŸŽ…

Another shoutout to these two articles that helped me navigate the initial setup process for this extension:

### WHY NO REACT?
The project is too simple to need react, I had a pretty intense timeline, so I wanted a fast and brutal solution, that's why I used jQuery. But in the future I will definitely integrate other frontend frameworks and more buzzword worthy stuff.
